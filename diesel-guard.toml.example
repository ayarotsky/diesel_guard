# diesel_guard configuration file
# Copy this file to diesel-guard.toml and customize as needed

# Skip checking migrations created before this timestamp
# Useful for retrofitting diesel_guard into existing projects
# Format: YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS (matching Diesel migration directory timestamp prefix)
#
# Example: Skip all migrations before January 1, 2024
# start_after = "2024_01_01_000000"

# Whether to check down.sql files in addition to up.sql
# Default: false
#
# Set to true if you want to ensure rollback migrations are also safe
# check_down = false

# Disable specific safety checks
# Valid check names:
#   - AddColumnCheck          (ADD COLUMN with DEFAULT)
#   - AddIndexCheck           (CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY)
#   - AddNotNullCheck         (ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL)
#   - AlterColumnTypeCheck    (ALTER COLUMN TYPE)
#   - DropColumnCheck         (DROP COLUMN)
#
# Example: Disable checking for ADD COLUMN and DROP COLUMN operations
# disable_checks = ["AddColumnCheck", "DropColumnCheck"]
#
# Default: [] (all checks enabled)
# disable_checks = []
