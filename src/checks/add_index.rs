//! Detection for CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY.
//!
//! This check identifies `CREATE INDEX` statements that don't use the CONCURRENTLY
//! option, which blocks write operations during the index build.
//!
//! Creating an index without CONCURRENTLY acquires a SHARE lock on the table, which
//! blocks write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Duration depends on table size.
//! Reads (SELECT) are still allowed.
//!
//! Using CONCURRENTLY allows the index to be built while permitting concurrent writes,
//! though it takes longer and cannot be run inside a transaction block.

Note: CONCURRENTLY takes longer and uses more resources, but allows concurrent INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. The index build may fail if there are deadlocks or unique constraint violations.

Considerations:
- Cannot be run inside a transaction block
- Requires more total work and takes longer to complete
- If it fails, it leaves behind an "invalid" index that should be dropped"#,
