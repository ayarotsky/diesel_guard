//! Detection for CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY.
//!
//! This check identifies `CREATE INDEX` statements that don't use the CONCURRENTLY
//! option, which blocks write operations during the index build.
//!
//! Creating an index without CONCURRENTLY acquires a SHARE lock on the table, which
//! blocks write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for the duration of the index
//! build. Reads (SELECT) are still allowed. The duration depends on table size.
//!
//! Using CONCURRENTLY allows the index to be built while permitting concurrent writes,
//! though it takes longer and cannot be run inside a transaction block.
