//! Detection for RENAME TABLE operations.
//!
//! This check identifies `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...` statements that rename tables.
//! While the rename operation itself is fast, it causes immediate errors in running
//! application instances that still reference the old table name.
//!
//! Additionally, on large, busy tables, acquiring the ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock required
//! for renaming can block or timeout, making the operation risky in production.
//!
//! The recommended approach is a multi-step dual-write migration that maintains
//! compatibility with running instances and avoids dangerous locks.

1. Create the new table with the same structure:
   CREATE TABLE {new} (LIKE {old} INCLUDING ALL);

2. Update your application code to write to both tables.

3. Backfill data from the old table to the new table in batches:
   INSERT INTO {new} SELECT * FROM {old} WHERE id > last_id LIMIT 10000;

4. Update your application code to read from the new table.

5. Deploy the updated application code.

6. Update your application code to stop writing to the old table.

7. Drop the old table in a later migration:
   DROP TABLE {old};

This approach avoids dangerous locks and maintains compatibility with running instances throughout the migration."#,
