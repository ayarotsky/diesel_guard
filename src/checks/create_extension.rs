//! Detection for CREATE EXTENSION in migrations.
//!
//! This check identifies `CREATE EXTENSION` statements in migration files.
//!
//! CREATE EXTENSION often requires superuser privileges in PostgreSQL, which
//! application database users typically don't have in production environments.
//! Additionally, extensions are typically infrastructure concerns that should
//! be managed outside of application migrations.
//!
//! Extensions should be installed manually or through infrastructure automation
//! (Ansible, Terraform, etc.) with appropriate privileges before running migrations.

1. For local development, add to your database setup scripts:
   CREATE EXTENSION {if_not_exists}{extension};

2. For production, use infrastructure automation (Ansible, Terraform, etc.):
   - Include extension installation in database provisioning
   - Grant appropriate privileges to superuser/admin role
   - Run before deploying application migrations

3. Document required extensions in your project README

installed by your DBA or infrastructure team before application deployment."#,
